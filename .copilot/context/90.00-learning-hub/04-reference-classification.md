# Reference Classification System

## Overview

All article references must be classified with emoji markers to help readers assess source reliability and authority at a glance.

## Classification Markers

| Marker | Category | Trust Level | Use For |
|--------|----------|-------------|---------|
| 📘 | Official | Highest | Official product docs, Microsoft Learn, vendor documentation |
| 📗 | Verified Community | High | Official blogs, recognized experts, peer-reviewed content |
| 📒 | Community | Medium | Tutorials, personal blogs, StackOverflow, community guides |
| 📕 | Unverified | Low/None | Broken links, unknown sources, unverified claims |

## Classification Rules (Domain-Based)

### 📘 Official Sources

**Domain Patterns:**
- `*.microsoft.com` - All Microsoft official domains
- `learn.microsoft.com` - Microsoft Learn documentation
- `docs.github.com` - GitHub official documentation
- `code.visualstudio.com/docs` - VS Code official docs
- `azure.microsoft.com/docs` - Azure documentation
- `*.openai.com/docs` - OpenAI official documentation
- `*.python.org` - Python official documentation
- Official vendor documentation sites

**Examples:**
- Product documentation portals
- Official API references
- Vendor technical specifications
- Official getting started guides

### 📗 Verified Community Sources

**Domain Patterns:**
- `github.blog` - GitHub official blog
- `devblogs.microsoft.com` - Microsoft developer blogs
- Recognized expert personal domains (case-by-case)
- Academic sources (.edu domains with peer review)
- Official company engineering blogs

**Examples:**
- Official blog posts from vendors
- Technical articles by recognized experts
- Academic papers and research
- Well-established technical publication sites

### 📒 Community Sources

**Domain Patterns:**
- `medium.com` - Medium articles
- `dev.to` - Dev.to community posts
- Personal blogs and portfolio sites
- `stackoverflow.com` - Stack Overflow Q&A
- YouTube tutorials and recordings
- GitHub repositories (non-official)
- Community forums

**Examples:**
- Tutorial articles
- Personal blog posts
- Community guides
- Video tutorials
- Code examples and repositories

### 📕 Unverified Sources

**Criteria:**
- Broken or inaccessible links (404, timeout)
- Unknown or suspicious domains
- Content without clear authorship
- Questionable reliability or accuracy
- Paywalled content without verification

**Action Required:**
- Fix or remove broken links before publishing
- Verify and upgrade classification if possible
- Add warning notes if link must remain

## Special Classification Cases

### GitHub Repositories

**Classification depends on ownership:**

| Repository Owner | Classification | Example |
|-----------------|----------------|---------|
| `microsoft/*` | 📘 Official | microsoft/vscode, microsoft/TypeScript |
| `github/*` | 📘 Official | github/copilot-docs |
| `openai/*` | 📘 Official | openai/openai-python |
| Individual/community | 📒 Community | user/cool-project |

### Session Recordings

**Classification depends on host channel:**

| Host | Classification | Example |
|------|----------------|---------|
| Microsoft official channels | 📘 Official | Microsoft Build, Ignite sessions |
| GitHub official | 📘 Official | GitHub Universe talks |
| Community channels | 📒 Community | User-uploaded conference talks |

### Redirected Links

**Use final destination for classification:**

1. Follow redirect to final URL
2. Classify based on final destination domain
3. Prefer using final URL directly in references

**Example:**
- Short link: `bit.ly/abc123` → `learn.microsoft.com/article`
- Classification: 📘 Official (based on final destination)
- Prefer: Use `learn.microsoft.com/article` directly

### Mixed Content/Context-Based

**When domain alone is insufficient:**

**Scenario:** Official tutorial published on community site  
**Example:** Microsoft engineer's tutorial on Medium  
**Classification:** 📗 Verified Community  
**Reason:** Combine author authority + platform context

**Scenario:** Community guide to official product  
**Example:** Unofficial VS Code tutorial  
**Classification:** 📒 Community  
**Reason:** Not from official source, despite covering official product

## Reference Organization
