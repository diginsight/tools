## Example: Simple Agent - JSON Schema Validator (Complete)

This example demonstrates validated role, tools, and boundaries for a simple agent.

### Use Case Challenge Results

```markdown
**Initial Role:** "Schema validator"

**Use Case 1 (Common):**
- **Scenario:** User provides JSON file and schema, agent validates conformance
- **Test:** Can "schema validator" authoritatively determine conformance?
- **Current Capability:** ✅ Clear - validates JSON against schema
- **Gap:** None for common case
- **Tool Discovered:** read_file (to load JSON and schema)
- **Refinement:** None needed for basic case

**Use Case 2 (Edge Case - External References):**
- **Scenario:** Schema contains $ref to external schema file
- **Test:** Should agent resolve external references?
- **Current Capability:** ⚠️ Unclear - "validator" doesn't specify scope
- **Gap:** External reference handling not defined
- **Tool Discovered:** file_search (to locate referenced schemas)
- **Responsibility Boundary:** IN SCOPE - resolve local file references, OUT OF SCOPE - HTTP URLs
- **Refinement:** "JSON schema validator with local reference resolution"

**Use Case 3 (Failure Mode - Invalid Schema):**
- **Scenario:** Schema itself has syntax errors
- **Test:** Should agent validate the schema before using it?
- **Current Capability:** ❌ Not addressed
- **Gap:** Schema validation step missing
- **Boundary:** ALWAYS validate schema before using it
- **Refinement:** Add to boundaries: "ALWAYS validate schema syntax before validation"

**Refined Role After Challenge:**
"JSON schema validator with local reference resolution"

**Refined Responsibilities:**
1. Validate schema syntax before use
2. Resolve local schema $ref references
3. Validate JSON data against schema
4. Report validation errors with line numbers

**Tools Discovered:**
- read_file (load JSON and schema files)
- file_search (find referenced schema files)

**Agent Mode:** `plan` (read-only validation, no file modification)

**Validation Result:** ✅ Role is appropriately specialized
```

### Boundary Refinement Results

```markdown
**Initial Boundaries:**
- ✅ Always Do: "Validate carefully"
- ⚠️ Ask First: "Before reporting errors"
- 🚫 Never Do: "Make mistakes"

**Refined Boundaries:**

**✅ Always Do:**
- ALWAYS validate schema syntax before using it for validation
- ALWAYS attempt to resolve local $ref references before flagging as error
- ALWAYS include schema line number and description in validation errors

**⚠️ Ask First:**
- ASK before validation if file is large (>10,000 lines) as validation may be slow

**🚫 Never Do:**
- NEVER modify JSON or schema files (read-only analysis agent)
- NEVER skip schema syntax validation
- NEVER report errors without context (line number + description required)
```
